# HOTEL BOOKIE

# INTRODUCTION
The web3 app is designed to revolutionize the hotel booking process by leveraging blockchain technology and NFTs. It aims to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient method for users to book hotel rooms. By utilizing NFTs, the app ensures enhanced security, immutable ownership records, and transparent verification processes. Users can have peace of mind knowing that their bookings are protected by blockchain technology, which provides a decentralized and tamper-proof system.


# APP OVERVIEW
The app is built with a user-friendly interface and an intuitive design to enhance the user experience. It caters to two primary user roles: Users and Verifiers. The app ensures a seamless experience for both parties, making it easy to navigate through the various functionalities and features.

## WHAT DOES IT DO
"Hotel Bookie" revolutionizes the traditional hotel booking process by leveraging blockchain technology and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). It provides a secure, transparent, and convenient platform for users to book hotel rooms as unique digital assets represented by NFTs.
With the app, users can browse through a curated list of registered hotels, select their desired room, and proceed with the booking process. Upon successful booking, the app generates a personalized NFT that serves as digital proof of ownership and confirmation of the reservation. Users can also generate QR codes associated with their NFT-based bookings for easy verification at the hotel check-in counter.

## TOOLS USED
The tool that was used to design this product with love from the main design to the prototype was FIGMA. 
 
## CHALLENGE AND I OVERCAME THEM
Designing an aesthetically pleasing and visually engaging user interface while ensuring the app's functionality and usability can be a delicate balance and I over this by conducting extensive user research to understand user preferences, needs, and behaviors. By leveraging this data, I created user-centric designs that strike a balance between aesthetics and functionality

## FUTURE PLAN FOR THE PROJECT
**ROOM RESALE:**
In future versions of the app, users will have the option to resell their room bookings in the NFT marketplace. This feature enables users who are unable to stay in the room or have a change of plans to transfer their booking to another interested party.

**MARKET VISIBILITY:**
The NFT marketplace showcases available room bookings for resale, allowing potential buyers to browse through the listings. Users can view detailed information about each room, including its location, amenities, and any additional conditions set by the original booker.

**PARTNERSHIP:** 
Other hotels can register on the platform so their available room can be listed as well.
